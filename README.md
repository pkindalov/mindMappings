# mindMappings
Repository contains **mind mappings** creating by me while *studiyng* , *reading* or *watching videos*  on **different topics** to help me **remember** different **conceptions** more **easy**.

For creating them I use mind master software which you can get from <a href="https://www.edrawsoft.com/mindmaster/?gclid=CjwKCAjw8MD7BRArEiwAGZsrBVEt4cMYvOGsYRRqUCjDDZX0dEhnrBgsBKiQ_lZMcs6tN1eGhG_9dxoCj6gQAvD_BwE">here</a>

In general **used colors** *don't have some special meaning except the **red color***. Where I use the it, *I **recommend** to turn attention there* because this mean that I evaluated them as important with some reason..
